USE ROLE GOV_AI_APP_ROLE;
-- 1) Confirm enriched view exists
SHOW VIEWS LIKE 'SOP_CHUNKS_ENRICHED' IN SCHEMA GOV_AI_PLATFORM.KB;

-- 2) Confirm Cortex Search services exist (and note service name)
SELECT *
FROM GOV_AI_PLATFORM.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICES
WHERE SERVICE_SCHEMA = 'KB'
ORDER BY CREATED DESC;

-- 3) Quick list (alternative)
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SCHEMA GOV_AI_PLATFORM.KB;

-- 4) Test a query directly against a service via SEARCH_PREVIEW
-- Example shown with canonical service name KB_SEARCH.

-- 6) Privileges sanity (service runs with owner’s rights; be careful who gets USAGE)
--   Granting USAGE on the service enables querying indexed content.
--   See Snowflake docs for details.
